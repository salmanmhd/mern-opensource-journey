# Before we start

### What are browsers?

Browsers interpret and display content written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, allowing users to view text, images, videos, and interactive elements on websites.
**The goal of a browser is to render some HTML files.**

### What purpose do HTML, CSS, JS serve

### How do they render websites

# HTML

  ```HTML
  <html>
    <head>
        <!-- It consist meta data such as the document title, character encoding, linked files. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY VISIBLE CONTENT -->
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
  </html>
  ```

<div>     <p>     <h1>       <nav>    <ul>    <ol>    <li>    <table>     <form>    <section>    <article>
```
